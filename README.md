# Deciduous fraction


This repository houses python scripts and codes used in mapping deciduous forest fraction of forest cover for the ABoVE domain in North America. Our objective was to map the spatial distribution of deciduous fraction (percent deciduous cover on a per-pixel basis) across Alaska and ABoVE project domain towards our primary goal of attributing the causes of the observed increased CO2 exchange in high latitudes.
